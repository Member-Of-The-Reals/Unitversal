# Unitversal

Unitversal is a unit converter that performs unit conversions based on a
text input by using information stored in a SQLite database. There are currently
over 1500 units in the database with more to be added in the future.

# Usage

There are three query types Unitversal recognizes: information about a specific
unit, converting a unit to all units of the same type and converting between two
units.

To get information about a specific unit, type in the search box the unit name
and double click the unit once it appears in the list below.

>Example query: meter

</p>

To convert one unit to all corresponding units of the same type, type in the 
search box a magnitude followed by the unit name.

>Example query: 1 meter

</p>

To convert between two units, type in the search box a magnitude followed by the
names of the two units where the names are separated by the word "to".

>Example query: 1 meter to foot

</p>

Symbols, abbreviations, and minor misspellings will still be recognized by the 
app.

Additionally, Unitversal can perform currency conversions as well. The currency
exchange rates are from the US Treasury Reporting Rates of Exchange API, and can
be updated manually from the settings or during startup. Note that the exchange
rates are updated every fiscal quarter with minor updates for deviations greater
than 10% and as such there is no need to update frequently.

# Commands

Unitversal also recognizes several predefined commands when typed into the
search box: ABOUT, EXPLORE, SETTINGS.

ABOUT and SETTINGS opens the About and Settings pages respectively.

EXPLORE opens the explore page. This can also be done by clicking the "Explore 
Units" button in the settings page.
